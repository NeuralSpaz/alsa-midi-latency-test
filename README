== Intro ==

alsa-midi-latency-test measures the roundtrip time of a midi message in the
alsa subsystem of the linux kernel using a high precision timer. It
calculates the worst case roundtrip time of all sent midi messages and
displays a histogram of the rountrip time jitter.

== Compiling, installing and running ==

The following libraries are required to build alsa-midi-latency-test:

 * debhelper (>= 5)
 * autotools-dev
 * automake
 * quilt (>=0.40)
 * libasound2-dev (>= 1.0.13)

Compile and install alsa-midi-latency-test as follows:

 $ sh autogen.sh
 $ ./configure
 $ make
 $ sudo make install

Run alsa-midi-latency-test as follows:

 $ alsa-midi-latency-test -L

   This lists all available midi input and output ports.

 $ alsa-midi-latency-test -i [input port] -o [output port]

   This runs the benchmark with the given input and output port. Note, that the
   input and output ports have to be connected using a midi cable in the real
   hardware to loop the midi message back.

 $ man alsa-midi-latency-test

   The man page contains documentation for all available command line switches.

== Results ==

Results of some benchmarks created with alsa-midi-latency-test can be found
in the benchmarks/ sub-directory. The setup of the midi-chains of the results
is as follows:

 * ua25ex.txt:          PC -> Edirol UA-25EX -> PC
 * midisport2x2ann.txt: PC -> MidiSport 2x2 'Anniversary Edition' port B -> PC

If you have an interesting setup, please send us you results so we can include
them here for further reference.
